## Transcription

The transcription functionality has been implemented.

## Post-Proccessing (Summary, etc.)

Currently, we do not have a post-processing pipeline. However, we have a few ideas:

- [ ] Transcription Correction
- [ ] Text Summarization (with many different modes?)
  - [x] Basic Summarization
- [ ] Mindmap Generation
- [ ] Visual Input Enhancements (with GPT-4 Vision, for table and diagram understanding)
